# cribbage

This simulation shows the average value of a cribbage hand is 8.2 pts.  It randomly deals out six cards, and chooses the highest scoring card hand (assuming no points from the starter).  Then a starter is added and the point value of the hand is calculated.  Currently doesn't score flushes.  

Plan to use this to make a game with an AI cribbage opponent.
